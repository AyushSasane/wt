# Question 18: Array Search and Sort Demonstration

## Problem Statement:

**Design and develop a website to demonstrate the following:**

1. **(a)** Searching and sorting an array of integer elements using JavaScript.
2. **(b)** Searching and sorting an array of named entities using JavaScript.

You can make use of Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for interactions.

## Overview:

This project demonstrates two approaches for searching and sorting arrays:
1. **Bootstrap Approach**: Uses vanilla JavaScript for searching and sorting integer arrays and named entities, with Bootstrap for responsive design.
2. **jQuery Approach**: Uses jQuery to handle DOM manipulations and event handling for the same operations, also utilizing Bootstrap for styling.

## Features:

- **Integer Array Search and Sort**: 
  - User inputs a string of integers (comma-separated) to form an integer array.
  - The array is sorted in ascending order and the user can search for a specific integer in the array.
  
- **Named Entities Array Search and Sort**: 
  - User inputs a string of names (comma-separated) to form an array of names.
  - The array is sorted alphabetically, and the user can search for specific names in the array.
