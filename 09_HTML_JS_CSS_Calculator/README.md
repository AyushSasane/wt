# Calculator Web Application

## Question 9

### Question:
Create a web page for a calculator using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It should have basic functions like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). Use appropriate tags like `<table>`, `<div>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.

### Steps to Build the Calculator:

1. **Create the HTML Structure (`index.html`)**:
   - Set up the basic HTML structure with `header`, `section`, and `footer`.
   - Inside the `section`, create a `div` to contain the calculator's layout using a `<table>`.
   - Add input fields and buttons for the numbers and operations.

2. **Add Basic Styling (`style.css`)**:
   - Style the body to make the calculator centered and visually appealing.
   - Style the calculator buttons to be large and responsive to user interactions.
   - Use a consistent color scheme and shadow effects to enhance the visual look.

3. **Implement JavaScript Logic (`script.js`)**:
   - Create functions for number input, operation selection, and result calculation.
   - Implement functions for each of the operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) using JavaScript.
   - Ensure that pressing "C" clears the input, and "=" computes the result.
   - Handle errors, such as division by zero.

4. **Testing**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to check the functionality of the calculator.
   - Verify all the operations work as expected and that input and output are displayed correctly.

### How to Run:
1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. The calculator should be displayed and functional in the browser.
